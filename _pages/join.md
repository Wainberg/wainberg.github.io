We are always interested in taking on postdocs, grad students, and undergrads. <a href="mailto:%6D%2E%77%61%69%6E%62%65%72%67%40%75%74%6F%72%6F%6E%74%6F%2E%63%61">Email Michael</a> a CV and cover email describing your research interests. Postdoc applicants should propose a specific research project, and others are welcome to as well! Undergrad and grad applicants should send an undergrad transcript (unofficial is fine) and grad transcript, if any.

We encourage applications from a wide range of backgrounds, though strong programming skills are a must! Biology experience is an asset but not a necessity; you can learn on the job. We are extremely open to remote work and flexible working hours.

## Postdocs

We offer competitive salaries and generous benefits. We welcome remote postdocs based elsewhere in Canada or internationally. 

## Grad students

We take Master's and PhD students through the [Institute of Medical Science](https://ims.utoronto.ca/application-deadlines-and-requirements). Please reach out to Michael before applying.

## Undergrads

We are especially interested in U of T undergrads looking to take research-based courses. We participate in the [Research Opportunities Program](https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/experiential-learning/research-opportunities/research-opportunities-program), which allows any Arts and Science student to work with any professor for credit through [courses offered by their program or college](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/search-courses?course_keyword=Research+Opportunity+Program). We also take students from program-specific courses like [BCB330](https://bcb.csb.utoronto.ca/bcb330y-project/overview)/[BCB430](https://bcb.csb.utoronto.ca/bcb430y-project/overview) for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, [ESC499](https://engineering.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/esc499y1) for Engineering Science, and [HMB496/HMB499](https://www.hmb.utoronto.ca/undergraduate/curriculum-course-info/research-projects-human-biology) for Human Biology. Undergraduate students from other universities may be able to join the lab through exchange programs like the [Mitacs Globalink Research Internship](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/globalink-research-internship).
