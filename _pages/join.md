We are always interested in taking on postdocs and grad students. <a href="mailto:%6D%2E%77%61%69%6E%62%65%72%67%40%75%74%6F%72%6F%6E%74%6F%2E%63%61">Email Michael</a> a CV and cover email describing your research interests. We are not currently taking on new undergrads.

To ensure you receive a response, applicants should propose a specific research project that meshes with the work we do in the lab - the more concrete and detailed, the better! Our lab works mainly with public data, so thinking about which dataset(s) you'd use to answer your research questions of interest is key. Grad applicants should also send an undergrad transcript (unofficial is fine) and grad transcript, if any.

We encourage applications from a wide range of backgrounds, though strong programming skills are a must! Biology experience is an asset but not a necessity; you can learn on the job. We are extremely open to remote work and flexible working hours.

## Postdocs

We offer competitive salaries and generous benefits. We welcome remote postdocs based elsewhere in Canada or internationally. 

## Grad students

We take Master's and PhD students through the [Institute of Medical Science](https://ims.utoronto.ca/application-deadlines-and-requirements). Please reach out to Michael before applying.
