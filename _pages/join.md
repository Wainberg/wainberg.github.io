We are always interested in taking on postdocs, grad students, and undergrads. 
<a href="mailto:%6D%2E%77%61%69%6E%62%65%72%67%40%75%74%6F%72%6F%6E%74%6F%2E%63%61">
Email Michael</a> a CV and cover email describing your research interests. Postdoc 
applicants should propose a specific research project, and others are welcome to as well! 

We encourage applications from a wide range of backgrounds, though strong computational skills 
are a must! Biology experience is an asset but not a necessity; you can learn on the job. 
We are extremely open to remote work and flexible working hours.

## Postdocs

We offer competitive salaries and generous benefits.
We welcome remote postdocs based elsewhere in Canada or internationally. 

## Grad students

We plan to take on Master's and PhD students through the 
[Institute of Medical Science](https://ims.utoronto.ca/application-deadlines-and-requirements).
Please reach out to Michael before applying.

## Undergrads

We are especially interested in final-year U of T undergraduate students taking thesis- or 
project-based courses like [BCB 430](https://bcb.csb.utoronto.ca/bcb430y-project/overview). 
Undergraduate students from other universities may be able to join the lab through exchange 
programs like the 
[Mitacs Globalink Research Internship](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/globalink-research-internship).
